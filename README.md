# Cash Machine
This is a possible solution to the following problem. It is an exercise in function manipulation - you would not use recursion this way in real life.

## Design Brief - Create a program that runs like a cash machine
1. There are an array of possible users with card numbers, pins and balances.
2. The console should allow someone to try and auth 3 times. It should notify if PIN or Card No. are wrong
3. It locks after 3
4. It allows you to withdraw up until Overdraught
5. It tells you your balance when you withdraw
 

Use Prompt to make it ask the questions
Use number keys instead of atm screen keys
See what you can do!!
