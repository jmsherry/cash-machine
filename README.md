# Cash Machine
This is a possible solution to the following problem. It is an exercise in function manipulation - you would not use recursion this way in real life.

## Design Brief - Create a program that runs like a cash machine
1. There are an array of possible users with card numbers, pins and balances.
2. The console should allow someone to try and auth 3 times. It should notify if PIN or Card No. are wrong
3. It locks after 3
4. It allows you to withdraw up until Overdraught
5. It tells you your balance when you withdraw


* Use Prompt to make it ask the questions
* Use number keys instead of atm screen keys
* See what you can do!!
